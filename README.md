Arduino_Library
===============

Several usefull Arduino Libararies I developed and use.

SwitchHandling:
A library for reading switches: Support reafing of edgeflanks, debouncing, and current state.
                                Support interrupts for the standard Interrupt pins 0 and 1 for Adruino Uno
                                
SerialMP3player:
A library for use of a SerialMP3Player
          All function of the Serial MP3-player have function and some examples. 
          
LEDModule5050:
A library for easy use  5050 LEDmodule
          An internal interrupt drives the 8 multicolored LEDs as easy as write to the Arduino's IO-pins.
          

More to follow e.g. mcp23017 lib needs to be tested more with inputs, outputs over I2C and 
interrupt possibilities of the mcp23017 used
